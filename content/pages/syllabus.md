Public Finance Field Requirements
---------------------------------

The following is information for MIT students interested in majoring in the public finance field.

The Public Finance major field requirement consists of two courses: _14.471_ _Public Economics I_ and _[14.472 Public Economics II](/courses/14-472-public-economics-ii-spring-2004)_. In addition, 14.471 can be combined with any of 14.472, _14.473 Health Economics_, _14.474 Advanced Topics in Public Economics_, or [_14.475 Environmental Economics and Government Responses to Market Failure_](/courses/14-475-environmental-economics-and-government-responses-to-market-failure-spring-2005)Â to satisfy the requirements of a minor field. 14.473, 14.474, and 14.475 may not be taught every year.

Public Finance Seminar and Luncheon Meeting
-------------------------------------------

The following information is for MIT students interested in public finance.

The public finance seminar plays an important role in exposing students to current research topics and in permitting students to meet some of the outstanding scholars in the field. The fall seminar is joint with the MIT Labor Economics seminar, and it consists primarily of presentations by students who are currently finishing their doctoral research. First and second year students intending to specialize in public finance are encouraged to attend. We also have an informal luncheon in where thesis writers present their work in progress. Students planning to specialize in public finance are welcome to attend.
